## Hosted Version

https://nc-news-ddhendon.herokuapp.com/api

## Clone and Install

Clone the repository into a local folder.
` git clone https://github.com/dd-hendon/nc-news-back-end.git`

Make sure node is installed up to the required version (see below). Make use of `node -v` if unsure of your current version.

Run `npm i` to install all project and development dependencies.

Make sure to create the local databases by running the setup script (`npm run setup-dbs`). Then seed them with data (`npm run seed`).

To test the app use the included test suite (jest and supertest) by entering `npm t app` in the project root. Be aware husky will prevent any commits via a hook if any tests fail.

## Local Environment Setup

This is to connect to local versions of the databases. 

First find and make a note of the development and test database names in /db/setup.sql.

Then create two files in the project root folder.

- `.env.development`
- `.env.test`

Set the contents of these files as follows, using the specific local database names found in setup.sql

In `.env.development`:
- PGDATABASE=_local development database_

In `.env.test`:
- PGDATABASE=_local test database_
